One notable approach is found in the `RowJson.java` file within the Apache Beam SDK, which is part of our codebase hosted on GitHub. This file outlines the use of Jackson's `JsonGenerator` and `JsonParser` for serialization and deserialization, respectively. The process involves custom serializers and deserializers to handle the conversion of `Row` objects to and from JSON format. Specifically, the `RowJsonDeserializer` and `RowJsonSerializer` classes are used to manage this conversion process, ensuring that Java objects are accurately represented in JSON and vice versa.\n\nAnother relevant piece of code is the `TableRowToStorageApiProto.java`, also within the Apache Beam SDK, which demonstrates the conversion of `TableRow` objects to protocol message format, suitable for use with the Google Cloud BigQuery Storage write API. This conversion process is crucial for interacting with BigQuery, allowing Java objects representing table rows to be converted into a format that BigQuery can understand and process.\n\nAdditionally, the `ProtoJsonUtil.java` file in our codebase introduces a method for converting protocol buffer messages to JSON, adhering to the proto3 JSON specification. This utility is particularly useful for cases where we need to serialize protocol buffer messages, which are often used for internal data representation, into JSON format for external communication or storage.\n\nThese examples illustrate the diverse methods and utilities employed within our codebase to convert Java objects to JSON, catering to different data processing and storage needs across various components of our infrastructure.\"<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nwhat is enqueue_membership_task<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nThe term \"enqueue_membership_task<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nwhat is the RME identity crawl scope named?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n- GleanAI: \"The specific scope name of the RME identity crawl, based on the provided context, is not explicitly mentioned in the snippets from the Glean Search Tool results.

Here's a summary of the key points:\n\n1. **Query Flow and Access Control**: Admin services play a crucial role in the query flow, where client interactions go directly to the customer domain, authenticated using enterprise SSO. This ensures that admin services are integral to maintaining secure and authenticated access to Glean's infrastructure. The least privilege access model mentioned indicates that admin accounts are restricted to performing exceptional operations only, such as deleting projects, and have access to monitoring tools but not to customer data.\n\n2. **Infrastructure and Security**: Admin services are involved in running instances of OpenSearch in Kubernetes clusters, which are secured with shielded VMs and additional security measures like Antivirus & File Integrity Monitoring software. These services act as a proxy for requests to OpenSearch services, authenticated via Google IAM, highlighting their role in managing and securing backend operations.\n\n3. **Query Endpoint (QE) and Webhook Handler**: The QE, a private service behind a load balancer, and the datasource webhook handler, a private Kubernetes pod, are part of the admin services. They enforce authentication and handle requests, including receiving webhook events from datasources, which are crucial for triggering crawl operations and ensuring data freshness.\n\n4. **Local Development and Debugging**: Admin services support local development and debugging, allowing engineers to run deployment local admin with curl requests, forge admin auth, and debug using tools like the IntelliJ Debugger. This facilitates testing and development of admin functionalities in a local environment before deployment.\n\n5. **Central Workspace Setup (CWS)**: Admin services are involved in setting up and managing the Central Workspace Setup, indicating their role in configuring and maintaining essential infrastructure components for Glean's operations.\n\nThese points illustrate that admin services within Glean's infrastructure are pivotal in managing query flows, ensuring secure access, running and securing backend operations, supporting local development, and setting up essential infrastructure components.\"<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nwhat is a product access group?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nBased on the documents and snippets provided from the Glean Search Tool, a \"product access group<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nwhat is \"frontend identity\" in the context of crawling?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nIn the context of crawling within Glean's infrastructure, \"frontend identity<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nwhen was RME made async and why?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n\nYAML Output:\nanalysis: ", "completion": "analysis: Parker is inquiring about the timeline and rationale behind making RME asynchronous.\ncategories:\n- updates\nactions:\n- Glean Search: RME made async\ninstruction: Look for documents detailing when RME was made asynchronous and the reasons behind this decision.

I see potential for us to impact their genAI for employee productivity strategy.\u00a0\n\nAfter reading through some of Ariel's recent interviews, here's my POV on how we can help Navan:\nAI talent (which is incredibly expensive and in demand) should be focused\u00a0on integrating AI into Navan's product, not internal processes. But it's not just Navan's customers that need AI - it's also their employees.\u00a0\nGlean allows Navan to deliver genAI to employees in a matter of days, creating incredibly\u00a0fast time to value\nAI is much\u00a0more complicated than throwing data at an LLM\nGlean uses RAG and a best-in-class enterprise knowledge graph to deliver highly accurate, permissions enforced, and referencable AI output for employees\nThere's a lot of noise in the AI market\nGlean enables Navan to apply a comprehensive genAI strategy for productivity through a single point of entry:\nOne platform to manage --> less sprawl & overheard\nMore cost effective ---> only need to buy one license per user\nBetter UX --> Glean's output has 360 degree view of your enterprise\nWould Ariel be open to a discussion around this, or perhaps introducing me to the right person?\"<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n\nYAML Output:\nanalysis: ", "completion": "analysis: To make the email more concise, focus on highlighting the key points and benefits of Glean for Navan without losing the essence of the message.\ncategories: ''\nactions:\n- Glean Search: concise communication examples\ninstruction: Use the examples found to rewrite the email in a more concise manner, ensuring the key messages and benefits are clearly communicated.\n<|eot_id|><|end_of_text|>"}

One concern we're hearing from other CIOs/CISOs is AI tool proliferation. How can you manage security, permissions of data, and safety at scale, especially if every department wants to build or buy separate tools for their own use cases?\n\nThis is a key differentiator for Glean - we offer an AI platform that enables you to apply a comprehensive genAI strategy across your whole tech stack.\u00a0\n\nIn case you're not familiar with Glean, it is a workplace AI assistant that connects to your company data (Gdrive/O365, Slack/Teams, Confluence, Jira, Github, Salesforce, Servicenow, etc) and gives employees a one-stop shop to find information and self-serve answers to their questions.\u00a0\n\nWe also provide a ChatGPT-like experience over that data so that employees can streamline workflows like debugging, ticket resolution, document transformation, etc.\n\nOne platform to manage, one user license for AI, one security audit, and a stronger UX for users because the output of Glean works off of a 360 degree view of your org, as opposed to the silo of a single tool.\n\nMy CEO, Pat, will be in LA on April 15, 2023 for the Milken Institute conference.

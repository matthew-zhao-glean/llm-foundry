According to the documentation found in the \"client.yaml<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nGetting a 404 when trying with a client api token<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n- GleanAI: \"The issue you're encountering with receiving a 404 error when trying to access the /listannouncements endpoint with a client API token might not be directly related to the permissions of the token itself. Based on the context provided, there isn't specific information about common issues leading to a 404 error for this particular endpoint due to client API token permissions. However, it's crucial to ensure that the client API token you're using has the correct permissions and scopes required for accessing the /listannouncements endpoint. The documentation suggests that permissions and scopes are vital for the functionality of client API tokens, as they determine the API calls the token is authorized to make.\n\nAdditionally, it's worth noting that there was a mention of a broken help-doc redirection related to client API tokens, which resulted in a 404 error. While this issue is marked as resolved, it indicates that there have been instances where 404 errors were encountered in contexts related to client API tokens. This, however, seems to be more about documentation accessibility rather than API endpoint accessibility.\n\nGiven the absence of direct information on common issues or specific permissions required for the /listannouncements endpoint leading to a 404 error, I recommend verifying the following:\n\n1. Ensure that the client API token is correctly configured with the necessary permissions and scopes. You might want to revisit the official documentation or the client API token management section in the Workspace settings to confirm this.\n2. Double-check the endpoint URL to ensure it's correctly formatted and corresponds to the latest API documentation. Sometimes, endpoints might be updated or deprecated.\n3. Consider reaching out to the engineering or support team with specifics of the error, including any request logs or details about the client API token used. They might be able to provide more targeted assistance or identify if there's an underlying issue with the endpoint or its accessibility.\n\nUnfortunately, without more specific information or direct references to common issues leading to a 404 error for the /listannouncements endpoint due to client API token permissions, these steps are the best course of action to troubleshoot the problem you're facing.\"<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\n- John Doe: \"{\n \"title\": \"Test draft announce\",\n \"body\": {\n \"text\": \"test draft\"\n },\n {\n \"startTime\": \"2023-04-01T00:00:00Z\",\n \"endTime\": \"2023-04-30T23:59:59Z\"\n }\n \"draftId\": 12345\n}\n\n\nformat this json\"<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nIt looks like there's a small mistake in the JSON structure you've provided.

One notable approach is found in the `json_converter` file within the CodeBaseX, which is part of our codebase hosted on SourceRepo. This file outlines the use of Jackson's `JsonGenerator` and `JsonParser` for serialization and deserialization, respectively. The process involves custom serializers and deserializers to handle the conversion of `Row` objects to and from JSON format. Specifically, the `RowJsonDeserializer` and `RowJsonSerializer` classes are used to manage this conversion process, ensuring that Java objects are accurately represented in JSON and vice versa.\n\nAnother relevant piece of code is the `table_row_converter`, also within the CodeBaseX, which demonstrates the conversion of `TableRow` objects to protocol message format, suitable for use with the BigQueryAPI write API. This conversion process is crucial for interacting with BigQuery, allowing Java objects representing table rows to be converted into a format that BigQuery can understand and process.\n\nAdditionally, the `proto_json_util` file in our codebase introduces a method for converting protocol buffer messages to JSON, adhering to the proto3 JSON specification. This utility is particularly useful for cases where we need to serialize protocol buffer messages, which are often used for internal data representation, into JSON format for external communication or storage.\n\nThese examples illustrate the diverse methods and utilities employed within our codebase to convert Java objects to JSON, catering to different data processing and storage needs across various components of our infrastructure.\"<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nwhat is membership_enqueue_task<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nThe term \"membership_enqueue_task<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nwhat is the RME identity crawl scope named?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n\nYAML Output:\nanalysis: ", "completion": "analysis: The user is asking for specific information about the scope name of the RME identity crawl within Glean's infrastructure, indicating a need for detailed and precise information.\ncategories:\n    - updates\nreadactions:\n    - tool_name: Glean Search\n      action:\n        Glean Search: RME identity crawl scope name\nwriteaction:\n    tool_name: \"\"\n    action: {}\ninstruction: Look for documents that mention the specific scope name of the RME identity crawl and provide the user with the exact name and any relevant details found.\n<|eot_id|><|end_of_text|>"}

This parameter acts as a marker or pointer, indicating the position up to which data has been fetched in the current crawl, and from where to begin in the subsequent fetch operation.\n\nIn the context of identity crawls, the checkpoint parameter is used to ensure that the crawl process can be resumed or continued from the last known state, without the need to start over from the beginning. This is particularly useful in handling large datasets or in situations where the crawl process might be interrupted and needs to be resumed.\n\nFor example, in the `Slack2IdentityRepository.java` file, the checkpoint parameter is utilized in the `listUsers` method to manage the state of user data fetching from Slack. If the checkpoint is null, it indicates the start of a new crawl or the first batch of data fetching. If the checkpoint is not null, it represents a serialized state (for example, a cursor or an offset) from which the next batch of user data should be fetched. This mechanism allows for efficient data fetching by enabling incremental crawls and by ensuring that each batch of data fetched is unique and sequential, avoiding duplication and ensuring completeness of the crawl.\n\nThe checkpoint parameter, therefore, plays a critical role in managing the efficiency and effectiveness of identity crawls, enabling the system to handle large volumes of data in a structured and stateful manner.\"<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nwhat are admin services in glean infrastructure/<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n- GleanAI: \"The documents from the Glean Search Tool provide insights into the functionalities and roles of admin services within the Glean infrastructure. Here's a summary of the key points:\n\n1. **Query Flow and Access Control**: Admin services play a crucial role in the query flow, where client interactions go directly to the customer domain, authenticated using enterprise SSO. This ensures that admin services are integral to maintaining secure and authenticated access to Glean's infrastructure. The least privilege access model mentioned indicates that admin accounts are restricted to performing exceptional operations only, such as deleting projects, and have access to monitoring tools but not to customer data.\n\n2. **Infrastructure and Security**: Admin services are involved in running instances of OpenSearch in Kubernetes clusters, which are secured with shielded VMs and additional security measures like Antivirus & File Integrity Monitoring software. These services act as a proxy for requests to OpenSearch services, authenticated via Google IAM, highlighting their role in managing and securing backend operations.\n\n3. **Query Endpoint (QE) and Webhook Handler**: The QE, a private service behind a load balancer, and the datasource webhook handler, a private Kubernetes pod, are part of the admin services. They enforce authentication and handle requests, including receiving webhook events from datasources, which are crucial for triggering crawl operations and ensuring data freshness.\n\n4. **Local Development and Debugging**: Admin services support local development and debugging, allowing engineers to run deployment local admin with curl requests, forge admin auth, and debug using tools like the IntelliJ Debugger. This facilitates testing and development of admin functionalities in a local environment before deployment.\n\n5. **Central Workspace Setup (CWS)**: Admin services are involved in setting up and managing the Central Workspace Setup, indicating their role in configuring and maintaining essential infrastructure components for Glean's operations.\n\nThese points illustrate that admin services within Glean's infrastructure are pivotal in managing query flows, ensuring secure access, running and securing backend operations, supporting local development, and setting up essential infrastructure components.\"<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nwhat is a product access group?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nBased on the documents and snippets provided from the Glean Search Tool, a \"product access group<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nwhat is \"frontend identity\" in the context of crawling?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n\nYAML Output:\nanalysis: ", "completion": "analysis: To provide information on \"frontend identity\" in the context of crawling, search for documents that discuss this concept, focusing on how it relates to the process of crawling within the infrastructure.\ncategories:\n    - updates\nreadactions:\n    - tool_name: Glean Search\n      action:\n        Glean Search: '\"frontend identity\" crawling'\nwriteaction:\n    tool_name: \"\"\n    action: {}\ninstruction: Find documents discussing \"frontend identity\" in the context of crawling and synthesize the information to explain its relevance and application.\n<|eot_id|><|end_of_text|>"}

These tokens allow documents to be sent to Glean via HTTP requests.\n   - **Client Tokens** are designed for making API calls to the Client API. The identity of these tokens can be scoped to a single user or be global, affecting the range of actions the token can perform based on assigned scopes.\n   - **Authentication Tokens** are created for the authenticated user to authenticate subsequent API requests. These tokens are passed to endpoints via Bearer Authentication to verify the user's identity.\n\n2. **Management and Creation**:\n   - **Indexing Tokens** can be managed and created by admins via the Workspace Settings under the Indexing tokens tab. They can be set with global permissions, restricted to specific apps, and even have an expiry date.\n   - **Client Tokens** are also managed by admins via Workspace Settings but under the Client tokens tab. These tokens can have permissions and scopes that govern the API calls they are allowed to make. Client tokens can be very powerful, and their creation is restricted to ensure security.\n   - **Authentication Tokens** are generated using a specific endpoint (`/createauthtoken`) and require BearerAuth for the request. The token includes an expiration time and is intended for the user making the request.\n\n3. **Security and Restrictions**:\n   - **Indexing Tokens** can be restricted to a set of IP ranges for additional security. They can also be made rotatable, allowing for periodic rotation to enhance security.\n   - **Client Tokens** have a detailed permissions and scopes system that defines their capabilities. They can be global or user-scoped, and their creation is tightly controlled to prevent misuse.\n   - **Authentication Tokens** are directly tied to the authenticated user's identity and have an expiration time to limit their validity period. They are used for authenticating API requests and ensuring that the user has the necessary permissions.\n\nThese differences highlight the distinct roles and management practices for each token type within Glean's ecosystem, catering to various operational and security needs.\"<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nhow to create indexing token<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n- GleanAI: \"To create an Indexing Token in Glean, you can follow these steps as outlined in the provided documents:\n\n1. **Access Workspace Settings**: Navigate to the Workspace settings in the Glean admin console. This is where you can manage and create various types of API tokens, including Indexing Tokens.\n\n2. **Navigate to the Indexing Tokens Section**: Within the Workspace settings, locate the section specifically for managing Indexing Tokens. This might be labeled as \"Indexing tokens\", \"API tokens\", or something similar, depending on the interface updates.\n\n3. **Create a New Token**: Look for an option to create a new token. This might be a button or link saying \"Create\", \"New token\", or similar. Click on this to start the process of creating a new Indexing Token.\n\n4. **Configure the Token**: During the creation process, you will likely need to specify certain details about the token. This could include:\n   - **Description**: A brief description of what the token will be used for.\n   - **Rotation Period**: If you want the token to be rotatable, specify the rotation period in minutes. This is an optional step and depends on your security requirements.\n   - **Scope and Permissions**: Depending on the system, you might need to specify the scope or permissions for the token. This defines what actions the token can perform or what data it can access.\n\n5. **Finalize Creation**: After configuring the token settings, finalize the creation process. This might involve clicking a \"Create\", \"Generate\", or \"Finish\" button.\n\n6. **Record the Token Details**: Once the token is created, make sure to securely record the token ID and secret. These details are necessary for using the token in API calls to index documents.\n\nPlease note, the exact labels and steps might vary slightly based on the current version of the Glean interface and the specific permissions of your admin account. If you encounter any difficulties or if the interface seems significantly different from these instructions, it might be helpful to consult the latest documentation directly or reach out to Glean support for assistance.\"<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nhow to create client token<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n\nYAML Output:\nanalysis: ", "completion": "analysis: Use Glean Search to find relevant documents on creating a Client Token, focusing on the steps and requirements involved in the process.\ncategories:\n    - updates\nreadactions:\n    - tool_name: Glean Search\n      action:\n        Glean Search: create Client Token steps\nwriteaction:\n    tool_name: \"\"\n    action: {}\ninstruction: Search for documents detailing the process of creating a Client Token in Glean, and summarize the steps and requirements found for the user.\n<|eot_id|><|end_of_text|>"}

One of the primary advantages is the ability to instantly find answers to coding issues, which helps in tracking down issues and gathering comprehensive information about code all in one place. This capability is particularly useful for troubleshooting problems with ease, as Glean answers questions about all aspects of a company's codebase, making it easy to get help with error codes and urgent pages. Moreover, Glean reduces the need for interrupting colleagues, efficiently unblocking progress without unnecessary back-and-forth.\n\nA notable example of Glean's impact is Acme Corp, which has boosted monthly productivity across their entire engineering team. Before Glean, employees struggled to find content within their ecosystem, and knowledge was siloed and fragmented. With Glean, Acme Corp has saved over 300 hours monthly, achieved a 65% adoption rate, and seen a 3x return on investment.\n\nGlean empowers engineers with Generative AI and distributes knowledge across teams, making it easy to onboard new projects quickly. It combines information from source control, chat, documentation, ticketing systems, and more to provide instant context across the organization and solve issues quickly. For instance, asking Glean about an error code can yield an instant answer back, based on the company's trusted knowledge.\n\nFurthermore, Glean helps in finding the right experts within an organization to assist with complex problems across any topic. It is designed with tech stacks in mind, continuously training on a company\u2019s unique language and context to improve search relevance without the need for manual fine-tuning. This feature supports a wide range of integrations, including Confluence, GitHub, GitLab, Google Drive, Jira, and Slack, among others.\n\nIn summary, Glean enhances engineering productivity by providing instant answers, facilitating knowledge distribution, reducing interruptions, and quickly solving technical issues, all of which contribute to significant time savings and increased efficiency for engineering teams.\"<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nMake it more concise<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nGlean offers Engineering teams key benefits including instant access to coding solutions, enhancing productivity by reducing the time spent searching for information. It facilitates knowledge sharing across the organization and integrates with major tools like Confluence, GitHub, and Slack. This leads to significant time savings, as seen with Acme Corp's 300 hours saved monthly, and a streamlined process for solving technical issues and onboarding new projects.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nCan you provide specific examples of how Glean has helped other engineering teams improve their productivity?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n- GleanAI: \"Based on the provided context, there are several case studies and success stories highlighting the productivity improvements for engineering teams using Glean. Here are the key points from these examples:\n\n1. **Acme Corp**: Before implementing Glean, Acme Corp's engineering team struggled with finding content within their ecosystem, leading to knowledge being siloed and fragmented. After adopting Glean, Acme Corp experienced a significant boost in monthly productivity across their entire engineering team. They saved over 300 hours monthly, achieved a 65% adoption rate, and saw a 3x return on investment. Glean facilitated easy access to coding solutions and knowledge sharing across the organization, leading to streamlined processes for solving technical issues and onboarding new projects.\n\n2. **Beta Inc**: Alex Johnson, the Director of Developer Tooling at Beta Inc, reported that before using Glean, the Developer Tooling team received many IT-style questions to help engineers set up their devices, and documents were hard to find, which didn\u2019t effectively answer FAQ questions. After implementing Glean, the team aimed to reduce the number of questions and time spent answering them. This indicates an improvement in the efficiency of finding information and resolving queries, contributing to better productivity.\n\n3. **Gamma LLC**: Emily White, VP of Engineering at Gamma LLC, highlighted that before Glean, employees spent a lot of time searching for documents such as product and technical specs and answers to questions that others had asked. After adopting Glean, Gamma LLC was able to quickly search for information across the company\u2019s apps, reducing the time spent debugging issues by quickly finding documents and answers. This led to a reduction in the time spent on searching for information, thereby improving engineering productivity.\n\n4. **Delta Co**: Delta Co's engineering team frequently used Glean to find information, enhancing the onboarding experience due to Glean's understanding of natural language and intuitive search interface. This resulted in decreased average handle times, which lowered the cost of calls and chats overall. Glean was instrumental in improving daily productivity for the team.\n\nThese examples demonstrate how Glean has been instrumental in enhancing engineering productivity by providing instant access to necessary information, facilitating knowledge distribution, reducing interruptions, and quickly solving technical issues. This has contributed to significant time savings and increased efficiency for engineering teams across various organizations.\"<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nWhy would a VP of Engineering want to adopt Glean.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n\nYAML Output:\nanalysis: ", "completion": "analysis: A VP of Engineering would be interested in adopting Glean due to its ability to enhance engineering productivity, streamline technical issue resolution, and facilitate knowledge sharing across teams.

The documents and snippets focus on comparisons between Glean and other entities such as Microsoft Search, Coveo, and the use of openAI's chatGPT for Enterprise. These comparisons highlight Glean's strengths in areas such as the number of pre-built connectors, setup ease and time, deep understanding of enterprise knowledge without additional work, personalized search experiences, indexing speed, user access and content permissions, customer and technical support, and the modern product experience.\n\nFor instance, Glean is noted for having over 80 to 100 pre-built connectors, facilitating easy and quick setup (typically less than 2 hours for integration with native cloud connectors), and providing a deeply personalized search experience that requires no additional setup. Glean's proprietary technology allows for a deep understanding of an enterprise's knowledge, building a full enterprise knowledge graph behind the scenes. This technology supports real-time indexing, ensuring that the search index is up to date within minutes of a change in the source system. Glean also emphasizes user-friendly access with pre-built support for SSO integration and enterprise permissions, alongside a modern product experience that includes an intelligent assistant feature, user onboarding, and education built into the product experience.\n\nWithout direct references to Dashworks in the provided context, it's not possible to offer a comparison between Glean and Dashworks based on the search results. For a comprehensive comparison that includes Dashworks, additional research or access to specific comparisons between Glean and Dashworks would be required.\"<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nWhat are the strengths of Dashworks compared to Glean?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n- GleanAI: \"Based on the provided search results, Dashworks presents several strengths when compared to Glean, particularly in its appeal to small and medium-sized businesses (SMBs) and its ease of onboarding. Here's a summary of Dashworks' notable strengths:\n\n1. **Ease of Onboarding for SMBs**: Dashworks has invested in creating an easy-to-use onboarding flow for small businesses. This allows SMBs to sign up and try out the platform within an hour without requiring assistance, assuming they are comfortable with Dashworks' security posture. This streamlined onboarding process is particularly fast for small datasets and does not require support to get data indexed and searchable.\n\n2. **Pricing Structure**: Dashworks offers a competitive pricing model that is attractive to SMBs. Their pricing tiers include a Team plan at $15/user/month with a minimum of 10 seats, a Business plan at $25/user/month with a minimum of 50 seats, and a custom-priced Enterprise plan for a minimum of 100 seats. This structure, along with the inclusion of SSO options and usage reports at different tiers, positions Dashworks as an affordable option for smaller teams.\n\n3. **Product Positioning and Features**: Dashworks positions itself as a solution to information overload and unorganized information, aiming to increase productivity and speed up decision-making through intelligent search. They emphasize AI-powered personalization, universal search, and automated Q&A as key features. Their product is designed to bring together documents, messages, tickets, and other knowledge scattered across a company's apps and people.\n\n4. **Federated Search**: Dashworks uses federated search, which combines the results of multiple repositories into a single search interface. While this approach can have implications for search quality and accuracy, it also allows for a broad search capability across various data sources.\n\n5. **Security and Privacy**: Dashworks claims that any data transmitted between connected applications and Dashworks is encrypted both in transit and at rest. They also assert that no data is shared with large language models (LLMs) for training, addressing potential privacy concerns.\n\n6. **Customer Centricity**: The co-founder of Dashworks has emphasized the importance of customer obsession, indicating a strong focus on customer needs and experiences.\n\nIt's important to note that while Dashworks has these strengths, the documents also highlight areas where Glean is perceived to have advantages, such as a more sophisticated product offering, a deeper understanding of enterprise knowledge, and a broader range of pre-built connectors.\"<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\ncan you elaborate on areas where Glean is perceived to have advantages against Dashworks<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n\nYAML Output:\nanalysis: ", "completion": "analysis: Elaborate on areas where Glean is perceived to have advantages over Dashworks by summarizing the strengths of Glean as highlighted in previous searches and documents.\ncategories:\n    - updates\nreadactions:\n    - tool_name: Glean Search\n      action:\n        Glean Search: Glean advantages over Dashworks\nwriteaction:\n    tool_name: \"\"\n    action: {}\ninstruction: Summarize the key areas where Glean is perceived to have advantages over Dashworks, focusing on features, technology, customer support, and market positioning.\n<|eot_id|><|end_of_text|>"}

Here are the key points relevant to your query:\n\n1. **Temporary Access with Strict Controls**: Internal personnel can request temporary ActAs access via an internal admin portal, which is granted for a limited time and requires specific permissions (temporary access token). This access is used for tasks such as debugging or inspecting customer data but is closely monitored and must follow a defined process, including the deletion of admin service account keys after use.\n\n2. **IP Restrictions and Security Measures**: For customers with IP-based restrictions on their data, Glean personnel can only access the data if their IP is temporarily whitelisted, and even then, the access is time-bound (up to a maximum of 3 hours). This ensures that only authorized personnel can access the data from approved locations.\n\n3. **Encryption and Cryptographic Controls**: Glean agrees to store and transmit customer data using industry-accepted encryption technology, except where technically infeasible. However, for debugging or inspecting system components, customers can grant Glean team time-bounded access to certain keys, which are stored in encrypted format and never leave the server.\n\n4. **Audit Logging and Justification**: All accesses to GCP system components and any actions taken using ActAs privileges are audit-logged.

The documents from the Glean Search Tool provide detailed instructions and insights into how Glean integrates with Okta for SAML and SCIM app setup, enabling automated user provisioning and deprovisioning. Here's a summary of the key points:\n\n1. **Okta SAML + SCIM App Setup**: Instructions cover creating and connecting the Okta SAML + SCIM app to Glean for provisioning/deprovisioning users. This involves creating a SAML app integration, enabling SCIM provisioning, and configuring settings such as the SCIM connector base URL and authentication mode. Users from your organization can then be assigned to the Glean Search Okta application for automated provisioning ([External] Okta SAML + SCIM app setup).\n\n2. **Glean Administrator Setup**: As a Glean administrator, you'll need to perform certain steps in the Glean workspace settings, such as adding the metadata URL shown in the \u201cSign On\u201d tab of the Okta SAML app you created. This is part of the setup for changing over from a different SSO provider or setting up your first SSO app with Okta ([External] Okta SAML + SCIM app setup).\n\n3. **Self-Serve Setup**: Glean supports a self-serve initial setup with Okta SAML+SCIM for single sign-on (SSO) with immediate user deprovisioning. After setting up Okta SAML, customers can set up Okta SCIM under apps. This process is designed to be straightforward for customers to complete on their own (What we built: Okta SAML+SCIM in initial self-serve setup).\n\n4. **Troubleshooting**: There's also documentation available for troubleshooting Okta SAML and SCIM setups, ensuring that customers can resolve common issues encountered during the setup process (Okta SAML+SCIM self-serve setup (troubleshooting)).\n\nThese documents indicate that Glean has a comprehensive support system for integrating with Okta SCIM, facilitating automated user provisioning and deprovisioning, with detailed guidance available for both the initial setup and troubleshooting.\"<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\ncan glean connect with 3rd party system statuses (like knowing the up/downtime for Microsoft, Slack, Zoom)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n\nYAML Output:\nanalysis: ", "completion": "analysis: User is inquiring if Glean can integrate with third-party systems to monitor their status, specifically regarding uptime and downtime for services like Microsoft, Slack, and Zoom.

Before Glean, he co-founded NetTech and was a Distinguished Engineer at MapMyWorld, leading teams in Search, Maps, and SearchSolutions.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nHow long has Glean been in operation?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nBased on the provided context, there isn't specific information regarding the exact start date of Glean's operations. The documents and snippets included in the search results focus on various operational aspects, such as creating BigQuery tables, discussions on hosting, setting up people data, quality projects for GleanChat, AWS integration, and running activity pipelines locally, but they do not mention when Glean began its operations. Therefore, I'm unable to provide a precise answer to your question about how long Glean has been in operation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nWhat are some key features of Glean?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n- GleanAI: \"Glean's key features, as highlighted in the provided documents, include a range of generative AI products designed to enhance workplace productivity and information access. These features are centered around the Glean Assistant, which is accessible through various platforms including GleanChat, Search, Document Summaries, and the Glean Sidebar. Here's a detailed look at some of the key features:\n\n1. **GleanChat**: A dedicated platform (gleanchat.com) where users can interact with Glean as if it were a colleague. It performs multiple searches to generate answers to user queries, citing specific documents for transparency.\n\n2. **Insights**: This feature provides metrics on Glean Assistant's performance within a company, including active users (monthly, weekly, total), chat messages sent, documents summarized, autogenerated answers, and the upvote/downvote rate. It also allows for the download of active user data as a CSV file.\n\n3. **Customization Options**: Glean offers several customization options, including embedding GleanChat within a company's own website or Slack, customizing data sources GleanChat can access, and tailoring the rollout to specific sets of users. Additionally, companies can provide a customized message to verify the authenticity of generated content.\n\n4. **Permissions and Security**: Glean enforces permissions set on documents, ensuring that answers are generated only from search results visible to the user. The system quickly recognizes and updates any changes in document permissions.\n\n5. **Generative AI Entry Points**: While Glean does not support turning on several generative AI entry points without others, it encourages reaching out to the team for specific needs.\n\n6. **Hybrid Vector and Traditional IR Index**: Glean is powered by a hybrid index that ranks documents personalized to a user's role and the people they work with, taking into account document popularity and accuracy. This approach is designed to provide superior search quality compared to a vector database alone.\n\nThese features collectively aim to simplify access to information, making it easier for employees to find what they need and focus on their work.\"<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nWhat is Glean<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n\nYAML Output:\nanalysis: ", "completion": "analysis: User is asking for a general overview or definition of Glean.\nreadactions:\n    - tool_name: Glean Search\n      action:\n        Glean Search: What is Glean\nwriteaction:\n    tool_name: \"\"\n    action: {}\ninstruction: Provide a concise overview or definition of Glean based on the most relevant document or snippet found.\n<|eot_id|><|end_of_text|>"}

They position themselves as a modern company wiki, focusing on organizing company knowledge into a single, easily accessible platform. As of 2022, Notion had approximately 250 employees and boasted notable customers including Airbnb, Uber, Netflix, Amazon, Google, Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, and Notion0. They offer a solution to the pain point of scattered and hard-to-find company information by providing a knowledge management system that consolidates all company knowledge into a single source of truth. This system is designed to address issues of irrelevant, outdated information through expert verification prompts that ensure the knowledge stored is both fresh and verified.\n\nNotion's pricing starts at $10 per user per month for most of its core features, with a higher price tier at $20 per user per month that includes access to advanced AI suggestion capabilities. They have a strong community of 1,600 active members discussing over 1,000 topics related to knowledge management, content verification, search, and analytics.\n\nHowever, there are noted weaknesses in Notion's system. The knowledge base must be built from the ground up, requiring significant manpower resources to populate company knowledge into Notion\u2019s Collections & Cards. This process does not work out of the box and indexing information can be time-consuming as Notion refreshes synced content every 4 hours. Additionally, the search functionality is not intuitive, particularly for content indexed from third-party sources, as it only searches through titles.\n\nNotion integrates with Glean, allowing Glean to fetch relevant information from Notion. This integration respects user access permissions, ensuring that users cannot see results they do not have access to. Glean indexes Notion content including Cards and Card Comments, performing a full crawl of Notion\u2019s content daily and refreshing the index with new content and any permission changes every hour.\n\nIn summary, Notion is recognized for its knowledge management capabilities, offering a platform that consolidates company knowledge into a single source of truth, supported by a strong community. However, it requires significant effort to set up and maintain, and its search functionality has limitations. Integration with Glean enhances its accessibility by allowing users to find Notion knowledge cards through Glean's search capabilities.\"<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nwhat integrations does Notion have<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n- GleanAI: \"Based on the information available in the provided context, there are specific details about Notion's integration capabilities, particularly its integration with Glean.

Glean, like many knowledge management, search, or content management platforms, continuously updates its features and supported file types to meet user needs.\n\n.VTT files are commonly used for storing subtitles or captions for video content. If you're looking to integrate .vtt files into a platform like Glean for searchability or content management, here are a few steps you might consider:\n\n1. **Check the Official Documentation**: The most reliable source of information on supported file types would be Glean's official documentation or support resources. These resources often list the file types that the platform can natively process.\n\n2. **Contact Support**: If the documentation doesn't provide a clear answer, reaching out to Glean's customer support or technical support team can give you a definitive answer and possibly some workarounds if .vtt files are not natively supported.\n\n3. **Consider Converting .VTT Files**: If Glean does not support .vtt files, you might consider converting them into a supported format. For text-based content,\"<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\ndoes glean crawl and index .vtt file types?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n- GleanAI: \"Based on the documents returned from the Glean Search Tool, there is no direct mention or confirmation that Glean currently supports the crawling and indexing of .vtt file types specifically. The snippets provided from the search results do not address the capability to process or index .vtt files directly. Instead, they discuss various topics related to file handling and transcription in different contexts, such as Teams meetings and video files on SharePoint or LumApps, but do not specifically confirm the support for .vtt files.\n\nTherefore, based on the provided context, it appears that there is no available information confirming Glean's support for crawling and indexing .vtt file types as of the latest updates included in the search results. For the most accurate and up-to-date information, it may be beneficial to directly contact Glean's support or technical team.\"<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nwhat are the file types and extension that glean supports indexing for?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n- GleanAI: \"Based on the provided documents, the specific file types and extensions that Glean supports for indexing are not explicitly listed in a consolidated manner. However, there are several mentions across the documents that provide insights into the types of content Glean can handle, as well as the capabilities related to handling structured and unstructured data. Here's a summary of the relevant information found:\n\n1. **General Capabilities and Approach**:\n   - Glean indexes a wide range of data, including metadata, identity data, permissions data, and activity data, which are crucial for personalization, security, and relevance. This suggests a broad capability to handle various file types and data sources.\n   - Glean's approach includes real-time sync, ensuring data is updated as it changes in the source application, including permission rules.\n\n2. **Specific File Types and Data Sources**:\n   - While a comprehensive list of supported file types is not provided, there are mentions of Glean handling documents, spreadsheets, and PDF files. For instance, there's a focus on improving the representation of spreadsheets and CSV files, indicating support for these types.\n   - Glean has connectors for most database systems, and customers can use Glean\u2019s Indexing API to add data from any database, suggesting flexibility in handling various data types.\n   - The document from IDC MarketScape mentions Glean supporting file types such as .pdf, .jpeg, .png, .gif, .xls(x), .doc(x), .ppt(x), .vsd, .rtf, .txt, and any other plain text extension. This provides a partial list of file types Glean can index.\n\n3. **Custom Data Connectors and API**:\n   - Glean offers an Indexing API that allows for the creation of custom data connectors. This means that beyond the out-of-the-box support, Glean can potentially index a wide variety of file types and data sources as configured by the customer.\n\n4. **Structured Data Handling**:\n   - There's an emphasis on indexing structured data from CRM and ticketing apps, as well as improving parsing of tables in PDF files and spreadsheets. This indicates Glean's capability to handle structured data effectively.\n\nIn summary, while a definitive list of all supported file types and extensions for indexing by Glean is not provided in the documents, it's clear that Glean supports a wide range of data sources, including documents, spreadsheets, PDFs, and various structured data. The platform's flexibility is further enhanced by the ability to create custom connectors via the Indexing API, allowing for the indexing of data from any database or file system as needed.\"<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nsummarize JIRA-1234 by component<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n\nYAML Output:\nanalysis: ", "completion": "analysis: The user is requesting a summary of a Jira board by component, which suggests they are looking for an organized breakdown of tasks or issues categorized by different components within a project.

Here's how this information can be incorporated into the email content to address potential areas of interest for the recipient:\n\n1. **Challenges and Progress with Guidewire**: It's important to acknowledge the challenges encountered during the technical setup between Guidewire and Glean, including issues with Confluence Overshare, Gdrive Red List and Crawl, Confluence Restricted Pages, and Mentions Not Working. Highlighting that these issues are either on the path to resolution or have been resolved demonstrates Glean's commitment to the partnership and its ability to overcome obstacles. This can reassure the recipient of Glean's dedication to ensuring a smooth and efficient partnership.\n\n2. **Guidewire's Primary Use Case and Opportunities**: Guidewire's primary use case for Glean revolves around self-serve answers to common questions, which has extended into a conversation about centralizing and improving the overall employee experience. Emphasizing this use case and discussing how Glean's intelligent solutions can further enhance the employee experience at Guidewire can be a key point of interest for the recipient. It showcases Glean's ability to adapt and expand its offerings to meet the evolving needs of its partners.\n\n3. **Glean's Solutions for Employee Experience**: Incorporating insights from the search results on Glean's solutions for improving the employee experience can enrich the email content. Highlighting specific solutions such as eDiscovery & Data Loss Prevention, Org Chart in HRIS, In-Application Search, and Knowledge Management demonstrates the breadth and depth of Glean's capabilities. These solutions address various aspects of the employee experience, from improving security posture and organizational knowledge to enhancing productivity and reducing manual tasks. Mentioning the business value these solutions bring, such as time savings, improved employee engagement, and cost reduction, can further pique the recipient's interest.\n\nBy weaving these updates and insights into the email, the content becomes more informative and tailored to the recipient's potential areas of interest. It not only addresses the current state of the partnership and the challenges faced but also highlights the opportunities for further collaboration and the value Glean brings to enhancing the employee experience at Guidewire.\"<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\n- Alex Johnson: \"anything you would add to this message\n\n\"Hi John Doe,\n\nHope you're doing well! In preparation for our meeting on Monday, here's an agenda of we\u2019re planning to cover the following:\nCurrent State, Challenges, and Progress with Guidewire: We'll start by revisiting the current state of the partnership, challenges we've encountered, and the progress we've achieved together.  \nWhy Glean for Employee Experience: Understanding your goal to establish a centralized hub where your employees can start their day, search and take actions, and reduce the noise across their communication channels, we'll chat through assumptions around the employee experience based on our research and opportunities to drive use cases with Glean.\nDiscussion and Next Steps: We'll then open for discussion, allowing us to dive deeper into any specific areas of interest, and solidify our next steps.\n\nPlease let me know if there\u2019s anything else you\u2019d like to add to the agenda.

This issue was thoroughly investigated and resolved by the Glean team, showcasing Glean's commitment to data security and privacy.\n   - Mention the progress on the **Gdrive Red List and Crawl** challenge. Guidewire had expectations for faster crawling of their Gdrive content. The resolution involved changing messaging about Redlists, allowing for immediate removal of content from search results using a list of folders/documents, demonstrating Glean's responsiveness to Guidewire's needs.\n   - Discuss the ongoing efforts to address the **Confluence Restricted Pages** issue, where Confluence had a lot of restricted pages that the API couldn't access. This illustrates Glean's willingness to work closely with Guidewire to find solutions that meet their specific requirements.\n   - The **Mentions Not Working** issue was resolved in collaboration with Guidewire, highlighting the effective partnership and technical cooperation between the two companies.\n\n2. **New Features and Updates Relevant to Guidewire's Goals**:\n   - Introduce the **Admins' ability to craft a custom disclaimer** beneath the chatbox as part of the new features. This can encourage users to be mindful of sharing sensitive information and verify the accuracy of chat responses, aligning with Guidewire's focus on security and accurate information dissemination.\n   - Mention the **Smart Composer: Doc & People Tagging** feature, which makes it easier to ask questions about documents and people within Glean Chat. Users can now type @ to tag a recently viewed document or coworker, enhancing the employee experience by facilitating smoother communication and information retrieval.\n   - Highlight the **Chat History** feature, where Glean Chat will now automatically save user chats on behalf of the user. This allows users to easily revisit conversations anytime within 30 days, potentially improving productivity by reducing the need to ask repeat questions.\n\nIncorporating these specific examples and updates into your message can provide John Doe with a clearer understanding of the value Glean brings to the partnership and how Glean's solutions are directly addressing Guidewire's needs and goals.\"<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nwhat subject should I use?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n\nYAML Output:\nanalysis: ", "completion": "analysis: The user is seeking advice on crafting a subject line for their email to another executive at Guidewire.

The handbook specifies that as a full-time regular employee of the company for more than one year, you are eligible for up to 6 weeks of paternity or non-birthing leave due to adoption or surrogacy, to be taken within the first 12 months following the birth or placement of the child.\n\nFor situations requiring more than the allocated 6 weeks, the handbook suggests discussing exceptional situations or personal needs with your manager. It emphasizes balancing additional leave with above-average contributions and the importance of proactive communication by managers if an employee's performance is being compromised due to extended leave.\n\nIf you believe your situation warrants an extension beyond the standard 6 weeks, it may be beneficial to discuss this directly with your manager or HR to explore any possible accommodations or to understand how additional leave might be managed, potentially using other leave types such as Paid Time Off (PTO).\n\nIt's important to note that while the documents provide guidance on the standard paternity leave policy, individual circumstances can vary, and direct communication with HR or your manager is the best course of action for personalized advice or requests for exceptions.\"<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nwho from HR can I talk to about this?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nFor discussions regarding paternity leave extensions, you can reach out to Alex Johnson from the HR department.

Specifically, you need to update the config variable `config_var_001` under the `[zendesk]` section in the deployment configuration. This should be updated with the email of the crawl user created for Zendesk. If this email is missing, you will encounter the runtime error in the logs, and your Zendesk crawl will not run.\n\n2. **Check Permissions for Help Center Articles**: If the help center articles are not being crawled as expected, ensure that the crawl user has been added to the permissions list for the Help Center knowledge space. This step is crucial for allowing the system to access and index the articles properly.\n\nFor more detailed information and assistance, you may also contact Alice Johnson and Bob Brown in the engineering team.

This is a crucial step to get acquainted with the company's culture, policies, and your new colleagues.\n\n2. **Meeting with Office Manager**: Have a meeting with our office manager, John Doe (johndoe@example.com), to ensure you've completed all necessary steps outlined in the onboarding checklist.\n\n3. **Laptop Setup**: Ensure the username of your laptop is in the \"firstname.lastname\" format. Immediately turn on FileVault and the Firewall on your laptop for security. Do not copy the key to your iCloud account.\n\n4. **Connectivity**: Connect to our office Wifi, SSID: FindItOnPortal, with the password \u201cSecure*123!\u201d. If that password does not work, use FindItOnPortal to find the correct one.\n\n5. **Profile Setup**: Add your headshot, working timezone, and phone number to your profile on Slack and other relevant platforms.\n\n6. **Slack and FindItOnPortal**: Review the Slack Norms guide, log into our corporate instance of FindItOnPortal, and make sure to install the browser extension when prompted. If you're part of the GTM team, use the production version of FindItOnPortal.\n\n7. **Familiarize with Sales Resources**: Review FindItOnPortal's 2023 sales pitch (deck + talk track + discovery questions) to understand how reps are introducing our \"AI-powered work assistant\" to prospects. This is crucial for your role in sales.\n\n8. **Relationship Building**: Start getting to know members of internal teams such as Product Marketing, Sales Development, GTM Enablement, and more. Prepare 2-3 thoughtful questions in advance of your meeting if you pursue 1:1s.\n\n9. **Onboarding Buddy**: Your onboarding buddy, Jane Smith, will assist you throughout the onboarding process. Make sure to reach out to them for any questions or guidance you might need.\n\n10. **Keep Notes**: You have the gift of fresh eyes. Keep notes of your first impressions and share them in #product after your first week.\n\nThese steps are designed to help you integrate smoothly into your new role and the FindItOnPortal team. Make sure to follow them closely and reach out to your manager or onboarding buddy if you have any questions.\"<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nwhat are the factors that determine the size of the FindItOnPortal's GCP cluster for a customer<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n\nYAML Output:\nanalysis: ", "completion": "analysis: User is seeking information on the criteria or factors that influence the sizing of FindItOnPortal's Google Cloud Platform (GCP) cluster for a customer, which suggests a need for technical and possibly internal strategy documents.\ncategories:\n    - updates\nreadactions:\n    - tool_name: FindItOnPortal Search\n      action:\n        FindItOnPortal Search: GCP cluster size factors customer\nwriteaction:\n    tool_name: \"\"\n    action: {}\ninstruction: Look for documents detailing the factors or criteria used to determine the size of FindItOnPortal's GCP cluster for a customer and summarize the key points.\n<|eot_id|><|end_of_text|>"}

Customers can opt-in via Customer Success Managers (CSMs) or Sales Associates (SAs) to a workflow where they stay on the previous release for at most two weeks while they test the new release. After this two-week period, they are automatically updated to the release from two weeks prior. This channel does not support updates sooner than two weeks. Once opted in, it will be effective within 2 weeks.\n\nThe Extended Stable channel is designed to be two weeks behind the Stable channel and incorporates applicable security patches and fixes from the Stable releases. It is intended for organizations that require a longer timeline to adapt to new versions, releasing updates once per week, every Tuesday. This contrasts with the Stable channel, which is the default option offering a balance of the latest features while being stringently vetted, releasing twice per week, every Tuesday and Friday.\n\nAdditionally, there are discussions and considerations around hosting options for Extended Stable, including the use of specific URLs for internal consumption and the potential for a separate vanity URL for staging environments to accommodate the two-week delay in releases. This setup aims to provide flexibility and security for organizations, ensuring they have adequate time to test new releases without compromising on the timely application of important updates.\"<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nprovide a table of open tickets for Innovatech Ltd. from TechSolutions Co. showing the id, status, assignee, subject and requester<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n\nYAML Output:\nanalysis: ", "completion": "analysis: Use Glean Search with the \"TechSolutions Co.\" app filter to find open tickets for Innovatech Ltd., including details like ID, status, assignee, subject, and requester.\ncategories:\n    - enumerate\nreadactions:\n    - tool_name: Glean Search\n      action:\n        Glean Search: app:\"TechSolutions Co.\" status:open company:Innovatech Ltd.\nwriteaction:\n    tool_name: \"\"\n    action: {}\ninstruction: Extract and organize the information into a table format showing the ID, status, assignee, subject, and requester for open tickets from TechSolutions Co. for Innovatech Ltd..\n<|eot_id|><|end_of_text|>"}

This includes adding internal and external facing documentation, playbooks, and more throughout April 2024. It's noted that AWS will be leveraged for new business only, with no bridge from GCP to AWS currently available.\n\n2. **AWS Implementations in Progress**: The Platform IN Sprint Planning document updated on April 15, 2024, lists several AWS-related tasks. These include the completion of the AWS Delete builds pipeline, the addition of an operation to rotate certificates for AWS accounts, and the successful implementation of aws-scio-prod + aws-apache-2 SSO + crawls. Some tasks like the replication checkpoint dashboard and Cloudwatch native metrics exporter are in progress or iceboxed for now.\n\n3. **Feature Parity and Implementations**: A document titled \"[Internal] AWS <> GCP Feature Parity\" updated on April 22, 2024, lists features yet to be implemented in AWS, indicating ongoing efforts to achieve feature parity between AWS and GCP platforms.\n\n4. **AWS Contractual Obligations**: A Slack thread from April 29, 2024, mentions that Glean has contractual obligations to implement some customers onto AWS, with known contracts for GlobalTech Inc., Innovate Solutions, NextGen Enterprises, TechPioneers (Contract12345), and Creative Dynamics.\n\n5. **Technical Implementations and Challenges**: Various technical tasks and challenges related to AWS implementations are being addressed, such as implementing SKIP_UPGRADE for AWS, dealing with deployment issues, and addressing specific AWS implementation questions from clients like Market Leaders Ltd..\n\nThese updates indicate a focused effort on enhancing AWS readiness, addressing technical challenges, and meeting contractual obligations for AWS implementations at Glean.\"<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nwrite an email to John Smith stressing the importance of hiring local Solutions engineers to support our biggest clients in Canadian and Acme Corp and that pausing hiring will negatively impact our customers and revenue<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n\nYAML Output:\nanalysis: ", "completion": "analysis: Jane Doe requests drafting an email to John Smith, emphasizing the necessity of hiring local Solutions Engineers in Canadian and for Acme Corp, and explaining the potential negative impacts of pausing hiring on customers and revenue.\nreadactions:\n    - tool_name: Glean Search\n      action:\n        Glean Search: hiring Solutions Engineers Canadian Acme Corp impact\nwriteaction:\n    tool_name: \"\"\n    action: {}\ninstruction: Use the search results to draft an email to John Smith, highlighting the importance of hiring local Solutions Engineers for Canadian and Acme Corp, and the potential negative consequences of pausing hiring on customer satisfaction and revenue.\n<|eot_id|><|end_of_text|>"}

This article aims to guide Glean Administrators on how to effectively manage document visibility in their Google Drive by utilizing redlisting and greenlisting options.\n\n### Overview\n\nWith Glean, administrators have the capability to control the visibility of documents in search results. This can be achieved through two primary functions: redlisting and greenlisting. These functions allow for the specific inclusion or exclusion of documents, folders, shared drives, and Google Groups from Glean's search index.\n\n### Redlisting and Greenlisting in Google Drive\n\n#### Google Drive Redlisting\n\nRedlisting refers to the exclusion of specific Google Drive content from being crawled and indexed by Glean. This ensures that the redlisted content does not appear in search results. Administrators can redlist content based on folders, shared drives, and Google Groups. \n\nTo redlist content:\n1. Navigate to the Google Drive self-service interface available to Glean Administrators.\n2. Define exclusion rules based on Folders, Shared Drives, and Google Groups. It's important to ensure there are no conflicts between exclusion and inclusion rules.\n3. For immediate changes, you may need to wait for a full crawl cycle or contact Glean Support to process the rule change.\n\n#### Google Drive Greenlisting\n\nGreenlisting, on the other hand, allows for the inclusion of specific Google Drive content in Glean's search index. This function is useful for ensuring that only selected content is searchable by users.\n\nTo greenlist content:\n1. Similar to redlisting, use the Google Drive self-service interface available to Glean Administrators.\n2. Define inclusion rules based on Folders, Shared Drives, and Google Groups that you wish to be crawled and indexed.\n3. Contact Glean Support if you need the rule change to be processed immediately.\n\n### Managing Document Visibility\n\nIt's crucial for Glean Super Administrators, appointed by the customer and approved by a senior Security Executive, to leverage global exclusion rule features for immediate updates. This can be done through the Hide Document dashboard in the admin interface, making the document invisible to all users via the search interface immediately.\n\n### Assistance from Glean Support\n\nAfter processing the rule(s) by Glean Support, exclusion clauses start to execute, and users should notice changes in search results within a short timeframe. However, it can take up to seven days for the excluded documents to be fully removed from Glean.\"<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nwhich tickets are currently the highest priority customer issues at the moment?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n- GleanAI: \"The current highest priority customer issues based on the provided search results are as follows:\n\n1. **Google Crawling Causing Excess API Usage** - Customers are experiencing random spikes in API calls related to Google, impacting their support team's usage. The issue is under investigation to understand the cause of higher rates when previous metrics appeared stable. A new configuration has been put in place to monitor the QPS throughout a full crawl resumption. The ticket is marked as \"Needs Verification\" and is owned by Alice Johnson.\n\n2. **Microsoft - Wind Down and Confirm Deletion of Data** - The task involves winding down a Microsoft instance and confirming the deletion of data. The instance has been decommissioned, and 28 alert tickets related to Microsoft have been closed. The status of this ticket is marked as \"Done\" and is owned by Bob Lee.\n\n3. **Amazon - NTP Off by Default** - Amazon requested that the NTP feature be turned off by default. The change has been implemented, and the ticket status is marked as \"Done.\" The ticket is owned by Charlie Kim.\n\n4. **Glean Search Alerts: Alert12345** - Multiple tickets related to Alert12345 for various projects and datasources, indicating issues with health checks. These tickets vary in status from \"Needs Triage\" to \"Closed\" and are owned by different individuals, including Diana Prince and Edward Nygma.\n\n5. **Slack - Recrawl Zendesk** - A request for a full recrawl of Zendesk for Slack. The full crawl has been triggered, and the health check for the Zendesk connector looks good. The ticket status is marked as \"Done\" and is owned by Edward Nygma.\n\n6. **Support Advanced Search Macro in Storage Format** - This task involves supporting the Advanced Search macro in storage format for a customer. The change caused some issues with wiki pages being re-indexed but not properly permissioned or accessible to users. The ticket status is marked as \"Done\" and is owned by Fiona Gallagher.\n\n7. **Dropbox - Crawl Tickets by Brand** - Dropbox requested the ability to crawl tickets for their Google instance by brand. This feature request is marked as \"Untriaged\" and is owned by George Bluth.\n\n8. **Post-Sales - GitHub - VPN/VPC Setup Help** - GitHub required assistance in setting up a VPN for a new Gitlab connector. The setup file has been shared, and the ticket status is marked as \"Done.\" The ticket is owned by Hannah Abbott.\n\nThese tickets cover a range of issues from technical problems with integrations and crawls to feature requests and setup assistance.\"<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nare previews and summarization supported for OneDrive files?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nPreviews and summarization for OneDrive files are currently not supported. This limitation is due to restrictions related to the Content Security Policy (CSP) set by Microsoft, which prevents the framing of OneDrive content in external platforms like Glean. Efforts to allow iframing of files by reaching out to OneDrive support for configuration changes have been discussed, but as of the latest updates, there hasn't been a solution implemented to support previews and summarization of OneDrive files directly. Additionally, there was an instance where OneDrive and SharePoint previews were disabled as a temporary measure for a specific environment, indicating that the capability to preview and summarize these files is not consistently available across all instances.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nwhat is the current status of the Salesforce connector?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n\nYAML Output:\nanalysis: ", "completion": "analysis: User wants to know the current status of the Salesforce connector.\ncategories:\n    - updates\n    - recent\nreadactions:\n    - tool_name: Glean Search\n      action:\n        Glean Search: Salesforce connector\nwriteaction:\n    tool_name: \"\"\n    action: {}\ninstruction: Analyze the results and share the current status of the Salesforce connector.\n<|eot_id|><|end_of_text|>"}

The issue involves an authorization error post-reinstallation, affecting the display of query results. The documents suggest that Glean Support has already taken steps by investigating logs and suggesting re-authorization. The troubleshooting session is a critical next step. The documents indicate that creating referenceable material for future issues is a practice, but no specific resolution steps are provided. The experts on the topic are likely to be the owners and updaters of the documents, such as John Doe and Jane Smith.

This limitation was highlighted in a conversation where it was mentioned that Glean referenced a code file, but the exact text snippet or some particular keywords used in its response were not visible in the file. This suggests that while Glean can reference documents and provide summaries or insights based on the content, it may not always pinpoint or highlight specific lines or sections within those documents, such as code files. This capability could significantly enhance the tool's utility by allowing users to directly link to the specific part of the document or code that Glean is referencing, making it easier to understand the context or verify the information. However, as of the latest updates, this feature does not seem to be available.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nAre there any plans or discussions within Glean about implementing the capability to reference specific lines or sections within documents or code files in the future?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nBased on the information available from the Glean Search Tool, there are no documents or snippets directly addressing plans or discussions within Glean about implementing the capability to reference specific lines or sections within documents or code files in the future.

In Glean mode, the system focuses on utilizing company-specific information, leveraging internal documents, data sources, and knowledge bases to provide responses. On the other hand, General mode operates similarly to a standard ChatGPT interaction, not specifically tailored to company-specific information but rather providing general assistance and information that's publicly available or not specific to the company's internal resources.\n\nThe privacy and permissions model ensures that when a response is generated in either mode, it is shown privately to the person who asked the question. This model respects the user's permission set, similar to how Glean Chat operates. Users have the option to share the response publicly if they choose, but by default, responses are private to ensure confidentiality and compliance with company policies.\n\nFurthermore, the system's architecture supports toggling between General and Glean modes, allowing users to choose the mode that best fits their needs at any given time. This flexibility is part of the system's design to accommodate various user preferences and requirements, whether they are seeking company-specific information or general assistance.\n\nIt's important to note that the system's design and functionality are subject to change based on user feedback and evolving company needs. However, as of the latest information available, this is how data storage and handling are managed when switching between Glean mode and General mode.\"<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nWhen a user switches into general mode during an active conversation, for at least some queries, is the previous context sent to OpenAI?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n\nYAML Output:\nanalysis: ", "completion": "analysis: The user is inquiring about the handling of context when switching to general mode during an active conversation, specifically whether previous context is sent to OpenAI.\nreadactions:\n    - tool_name: Glean Search\n      action:\n        Glean Search: general mode context handling OpenAI\nwrite_analysis: Find answer to user message and display to the user.\nwriteaction:\n    tool_name: displaytool\n    action:\n        response: Placeholder()\ninstruction: Search for documents detailing how context is managed when switching to general mode and whether previous conversation context is sent to OpenAI.

Here's a detailed breakdown based on the provided documents:\n\n1. **VPC Firewall Policies**: These policies are deployed to the Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) when the project is created. A key feature relevant to bastion VM SSH access is the policy that only allows SSH access from Google IAP tunnel to the bastion machine. This means that direct SSH access from the internet to the bastion VM is not permitted, enhancing the security of the access. The policies also include ingress control by only opening certain ports. These firewall settings can be configured with project-level IAM permissions, and the `service.account@example.com` service account has permission to change these settings. For security-sensitive customers, there might be additional steps involving consent and temporary permission granting for deploying changes to the firewall settings (Source: GCP Firewall Policies - Egress Control).\n\n2. **Identity-Aware Proxy (IAP) for SSH**: The use of Google IAP for SSH access to the bastion VM adds an additional layer of security. IAP works by verifying the identity of the user and the context of the request to determine if the user should be allowed access. This means that even if someone has the SSH key, they won't be able to access the bastion VM without also being authenticated and authorized by IAP. This is implied in the firewall policy that only allows SSH access from Google IAP tunnel to the bastion machine.\n\n3. **Deployment and Access Control**: The documents also mention various deployment and access control mechanisms, such as the use of owner keys for activating access to GCP projects and specific instructions for SSH into proxy instances which might be part of the broader security and access management practices. However, these are more about general access control rather than specific to bastion VM SSH access.\n\nIn summary, the security measures for bastion VM SSH access involve strict VPC firewall policies that restrict access to the bastion VM to only those coming through the Google IAP tunnel, thereby leveraging Google IAP's identity and context-based access control mechanisms.\"<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\ncan you prepare a document on our cybersecurity practices to share with a customer?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n- GleanAI: \"To prepare a document on our cybersecurity practices to share with a customer, we can draw from several key sources that highlight Glean's approach to cybersecurity, as well as general best practices in the industry. Here's a synthesis based on the relevant documents from the Glean Search Tool:\n\n1. **Glean\u2019s Security Posture** (Source: CISO Messaging document on GDrive):\n   - Glean offers a single tenant solution where customer data can reside behind their own firewalls & encryption, ensuring enhanced data security.\n   - There is an option for self-hosting in a private GCP or AWS project, which includes customer-hosted key options for the Language Model (LLM) of choice. This setup ensures that data can be isolated to the customer's cloud project, so data never leaves if the cloud provider & LLM provider are the same.\n   - Glean supports 0-day data retention if the data needs to be routed to external LLM, minimizing data exposure.\n   - Enhanced governance over sensitive content/information is achieved through redlisting.\n   - Glean is permission-aware at the source system level, ensuring that nothing is indexed for search results that an individual should not have access to.\n\n2. **Cybersecurity Threat Landscape and Best Practices** (Source: CISO Messaging document on GDrive):\n   - The document outlines key areas of concern and focus for CISOs, including the evolving cybersecurity threat landscape, regulatory compliance, cloud security, remote work security, supply chain security, security awareness and training, incident response and recovery, budget and resource constraints, emerging technologies, political dynamics, and effective communication with the board and executive team.\n\n3. **Collaboration with Industry Leaders**:\n   - Glean is working with security leaders at companies like Citi, T-Mobile, Uber, & Nvidia to ensure they can reap the efficiency benefits of Generative AI without introducing unneeded risk to their businesses.\n\n4. **Technical and Architectural Considerations** (Source: [INTERNAL ONLY] DBS Bank Security Additional Q&A document on GDrive):\n   - For more detailed technical insights into Glean's data security practices, the document suggests referring to the Data Security Practices and Technical Architecture documents.\n\nThis synthesis provides a comprehensive overview of Glean's cybersecurity practices, focusing on our security posture, collaboration with industry leaders, and adherence to best practices in cybersecurity threat management and regulatory compliance.

Use this context to provide answers to a customer support agent who needs actionable information:\n\nAcme Corp encountered issues with the GleanBot app after reinstalling it, leading to error messages and altered functionality where query results are posted as ephemeral messages instead of in modals.

The documents suggest that Glean Support has already taken steps by investigating logs and suggesting re-authorization. The troubleshooting session is a critical next step. The documents indicate that creating referenceable material for future issues is a practice, but no specific resolution steps are provided. The experts on the topic are likely to be the owners and updaters of the documents, such as Jane Smith and Robert Brown.

Here are the key advantages based on the information provided:\n\n1. **Improves Accuracy and Reduces Hallucinations**: Traditional LLMs can sometimes present incorrect information as fact. RAG addresses this by grounding LLM responses in real, external enterprise knowledge that can be traced and referenced, thus reducing the occurrence of hallucinations and improving the accuracy of the information provided.\n\n2. **Enhances Knowledge Discovery and Productivity**: By leveraging an external discovery system for knowledge retrieval, RAG enables LLMs to access the most relevant pieces of enterprise knowledge for each query. This capability supercharges knowledge discovery and productivity, making it easier to keep up with the pace of competition.\n\n3. **Cost-Efficiency and Scalability**: Continuously retraining models with new information is not only unrealistic but also expensive. RAG offers a more cost-efficient solution by utilizing a robust knowledge retrieval system in tandem with an LLM, ensuring that results are always relevant, recent, and permissions-aware without the need for constant retraining.\n\n4. **Supports Complex and Fast-Moving Work Environments**: Fine-tuning models to answer nuanced questions specific to a workplace can be challenging and may still result in inaccuracies. RAG, by providing models with access to relevant, recent, and referenceable knowledge, enables the generation of well-informed responses to queries grounded in real enterprise information, making it ideal for complex and fast-moving work environments.\n\n5. **Permissions Awareness**: In an enterprise setting, it's crucial that any generative AI solution is aware of permissions to ensure that sensitive information is handled appropriately. RAG's integration with knowledge retrieval engines that consider factors like relevancy, recency, and permissions makes it an ideal solution for maintaining data privacy and security.\n\nIn summary, RAG significantly enhances the capabilities of LLMs by ensuring that the generated content is accurate, relevant, and grounded in real-world knowledge, making it a powerful tool for enterprises looking to leverage generative AI technologies.\"<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nHow do I debug <error>?

If not, complete these steps first.\n   - Follow the one-time setup actions meticulously. These include enabling encryption, setting up a firewall, and ensuring your Mac OS X and Chrome versions are up-to-date. Avoid installing personal applications on your work laptop.\n\n2. **Software Installation**:\n   - Install necessary software including Docker. Initialize Docker by running `open /Applications/Docker.app` and `colima start`. If you encounter any issues, such as Docker images running out of memory (OOM), you might need to adjust Docker settings or restart it with specific commands (`mv ~/.docker ~/.docker.bak` and `colima restart`).\n   - For Google Cloud access, follow the gcloud setup instructions and authenticate your requests as detailed in the provided links. This might involve moving your `.docker` directory and configuring Docker with `gcloud auth configure-docker`.\n   - Consider adding GitHub Copilot to your code editor for enhanced coding assistance. You can request reimbursement for this through the #help-general-admin channel on Slack.\n\n3. **Security Training and Best Practices**:\n   - Review the security training documents to understand how to keep your laptop secure and gain access to customer deployments for debugging. This includes verifying encryption and firewall settings, using two-factor authentication (2FA) for sensitive information, and being cautious with your gcloud configuration.\n   - Before traveling with your work laptop, ensure you have logged out of gcloud and scrubbed your laptop for any sensitive keys. Consider using a VPN when connecting to untrusted networks.\n\n4. **Other Tools and Configurations**:\n   - Use Loom for internal use and sharing product issues or bugs. Connect Slack to Jira and GitHub for efficient workflow management.\n   - If you encounter a \"Too many connections\" issue, search for a Slack thread from Morgan which contains instructions on how to increase this number.\n\n5. **Being Reachable for Critical Issues**:\n   - Configure your work phone to add the pager number 555-1234 as a contact, ensuring it can bypass silent mode for calls from this number. This is crucial for being reachable for critical issues.\n\n6. **Development Environment Setup**:\n   - For contributions to the Apache Beam project or\"<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nHow can I issue my first PR?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n\nYAML Output:\nanalysis: ", "completion": "analysis: Since the user is new and asking about issuing their first PR, search for documents that provide a step-by-step guide or best practices for new engineers on how to contribute to projects and issue PRs.\ncategories:\n    - code\nreadactions:\n    - tool_name: Glean Search\n      action:\n        Glean Search: first PR guide\n    - tool_name: Glean Search\n      action:\n        Glean Search: how to contribute code\nwrite_analysis: Provide guidance on how to issue their first Pull Request (PR) based on company documentation or general best practices available within the company.\nwriteaction:\n    tool_name: displaytool\n    action:\n        response: Placeholder()\ninstruction: Find documents that outline the process for contributing to projects and issuing a PR, especially tailored for new engineers.

There is a mention of web history-based connectors in the context of the types of connectors supported by Glean, indicating that they typically involve indexing content based on users' web browsing history within an organization. However, detailed information on how these connectors work, their setup, or specific features is not provided in the search results.\n\nFor a comprehensive understanding of web history-based connectors, including their implementation, capabilities, and how they can be utilized within Glean's enterprise search software, it would be advisable to consult the Glean Developer Platform directly or reach out to Glean's technical support team for more detailed documentation or guidance.\"<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nHow do I get started with a custom connector?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nHow do I get started with a custom connector?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n- GleanAI: \"To get started with a custom connector in Glean, you'll want to follow these key steps based on the provided documents:\n\n1. **Familiarize Yourself with the Basics**:\n   - Understand the structure and requirements of custom connectors within the Glean ecosystem. This includes getting to know the different types of connectors Glean supports (native, push API, web history-based connectors) and their capabilities.\n\n2. **Review Documentation and Resources**:\n   - Review the document titled \"Connector Development Guide\" available at Google Docs, which outlines the process Glean follows when building custom connectors, including vetting, design, and deployment phases.\n   - Check the \"App Connectors For Glean's Enterprise Search Software\" page on the Glean website for an overview of connector types.\n   - Look into the CustomDatasourceConfig file in the Glean SDK on GitHub for custom datasource configurations.\n\n3. **Set Up a Datasource**:\n   - Create a datasource that you can use to index documents, identity information, etc. This can be done via the Glean custom app setup page in Workspace Settings for Glean admins, or by using the /adddatasource API endpoint.\n   - Configure the datasource with necessary details such as name, displayName, datasourceCategory, and urlRegex. For entity datasources, set the isEntityDatasource boolean to true.\n\n4. **Index a Document for the Datasource**:\n   - Use the Indexing API to index a document with the necessary details like datasource, objectType, id, title, body, permissions, and viewURL. This step is crucial for making your content searchable within Glean.\n\n5. **Custom Entity Indexing** (If Applicable):\n   - If your custom connector involves indexing custom entities, use the Documents API with the DocumentDefinition model to represent these entities. Include necessary fields like datasource, id, title, updatedAt, objectType, and customProperties.\n\n6. **Testing and Launch**:\n   - Conduct a Connector QA Testing involving stakeholders from CS, Engineering, Product, and Sales to ensure the connector is ready for crawl and documents can be populated.\n   - Once QA has signed off on connector testing, the connector is ready to be added to Glean\u2019s suite of integrations and deployed to customers.\n\n7. **Additional Steps for Launch**:\n   - Coordinate with the marketing and sales teams for the announcement of the new connector. This includes adding the connector logo to the Glean website and posting updates on the Product Updates Blog\"<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nHow do I get started on a custom connector?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n\nYAML Output:\nanalysis: ", "completion": "analysis: No further action is needed as the user's query has been directly addressed with a summary of the steps to\nreadactions: []\nwrite_analysis: Since the user has repeated their question, it indicates they might have missed or need further clarification on the previous response.

Here's a step-by-step guide based on the provided context:\n\n1. **Understand Custom Connector Basics**: Begin by reviewing the \"ConnectorBasics.pdf\" document. This document outlines the process Glean follows when building custom connectors, including vetting, design, and deployment phases. It's crucial to understand these steps, especially if you're working on a connector for a customer.\n\n2. **Familiarize Yourself with Glean's Connector Types**: Visit the \"ConnectorTypes.html\" page on the Glean website to get an overview of the types of connectors Glean supports. This includes native, push API, and web history-based connectors. Understanding the differences and capabilities of each type will help you decide the best approach for your custom connector.\n\n3. **Review the Custom Datasource Configuration**: The ConfigSDK.yml file in the Glean SDK contains definitions for custom datasource configurations. This includes options for icon URLs, hiding built-in facets, URL and title canonicalization, and quicklinks. Reviewing this file will give you insights into the configuration options available for custom connectors.\n\n4. **Code Snippets and Commit References**: Look at specific commits and code snippets for practical examples of how custom datasources are handled in the codebase. For instance, a commit titled \"Commit12345\" addresses an issue with instance IDs in custom datasource forms. Reviewing the changes can provide you with insights into form handling and datasource initialization.\n\n5. **Additional Resources**: While not directly related to coding, documents like \"DeploymentGuide.docx\" might offer additional context or steps relevant to deploying custom connectors in a customer's environment.\n\nBy reviewing these resources and understanding the structure and requirements of Glean's custom connectors, you'll be well-equipped to start writing code for a new custom connector. Remember to consider the specific needs of the connector you're developing, such as the data sources it will interact with and the type of content it will index.\"<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nWhat are the different types of connectors supported by Glean?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n\nYAML Output:\nanalysis: ", "completion": "analysis: The user is seeking information on the types of connectors Glean supports, which suggests they need a summary or overview rather than detailed technical documentation.\ncategories:\n    - enumerate\nreadactions:\n    - tool_name: Glean Search\n      action:\n        Glean Search: types of connectors supported by Glean\nwrite_analysis: Provide a concise response to the user's query about the different types of connectors supported by Glean, using information from the company's resources.\nwriteaction:\n    tool_name: displaytool\n    action:\n        response: 'Glean supports three main types of connectors: Native Connectors, which are built-in and provide seamless integration with various applications; Push API Connectors, which allow developers to push data to Glean from any source; and Web History Connectors, designed to index web-based content for searchability within Glean.

Here's a breakdown of the steps and resources that will guide you through the process:\n\n1. **Understand Custom Connector Basics:**\n   - Begin by reviewing the document titled \"[INTERNAL] Custom Connectors\" available at [Google Docs](docs.google.com). This document outlines the process Glean follows when building custom connectors, including vetting, design, and deployment phases. It's crucial to understand these steps, especially if you're working on a connector for a customer.\n\n2. **Familiarize Yourself with Glean's Connector Types:**\n   - The \"App Connectors For Glean's Enterprise Search Software\" page on the Glean website provides an overview of the types of connectors Glean supports, including native, push API, and web history-based connectors. Understanding the differences and capabilities of each type will help you decide the best approach for your custom connector.\n\n3. **Review the Custom Datasource Configuration:**\n   - The `custom_datasource_config.py` file in the Glean SDK contains definitions for custom datasource configurations. This includes options for icon URLs, hiding built-in facets, URL and title canonicalization, and quicklinks. Reviewing this file will give you insights into the configuration options available for custom connectors.\n\n4. **Code Snippets and Commit References:**\n   - The commit titled \"[admin][custom_ds][CP] Fix new custom datasource loads existing custom datasource\" addresses an issue with instance IDs in custom datasource forms. While this commit primarily fixes a bug, reviewing the changes can provide you with a practical example of how custom datasources are handled in the codebase. Pay attention to the modifications in `CustomDatasourceSetupForm.tsx` and related files for insights into form handling and datasource initialization.\n\n5. **Additional Resources:**\n   - Although not directly related to coding, the \"SE, Start Here: New GCP Deploy, Glean hosted\" document on Confluence mentions configuring connectors for customers. It might offer additional context or steps relevant to deploying custom connectors in a customer's environment.\n\nBy reviewing these resources\"<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nWho do I contact for custom connector details?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nFor details on custom connectors, you should contact Shivam Patel, who is the Principal Solution Architect in the Sales department.

According to a document from the Code Search Tool, there's a constant defined as `cMinExpectedFollowups = 3`, which indicates that the minimum expected number of follow-ups is three. This is further supported by a function `parseFollowupQuestions` that, if the number of follow-up questions is less than this minimum expected count, logs a parsing error indicating that there might be a parsing issue due to the insufficient number of follow-ups. This implementation detail suggests that the system is designed to expect at least three follow-up questions to proceed with parsing and returning these follow-ups, likely to ensure a certain level of comprehensiveness or detail in the follow-up interaction. This mechanism is in place to handle cases where fewer than three follow-ups might not provide enough context or information for the intended purpose.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\ncreate a jira ticket and assign it to me<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n\nYAML Output:\nanalysis: ", "completion": "analysis: No additional information is needed from the user to proceed with creating the JIRA ticket.\nreadactions: []\nwrite_analysis: Create a JIRA ticket regarding the follow-up question implementation detail and assign it to Emily White.\nwriteaction:\n    tool_name: createjiraissueexecution\n    action:\n        assignee: emily.white@example.com\n        description: Investigate and potentially revise the implementation detail where the system does not return follow-ups if there are less than 3 of them.

Here's a summary of the key steps based on the provided documents:\n\n1. **Define the Need and Stakeholders**: Start by identifying the need for a new connector. This involves understanding connector feasibility and customer requirements. A Product Manager, currently responsible for connectors, will drive this phase. You'll need to create a dedicated communication channel, such as on Slack, and loop in all relevant stakeholders including members from Customer Success (CS), Design, Engineering, Product, Quality Assurance (QA), and Sales.\n\n2. **Connector Product Requirements Document (PRD)**: The next step involves working on the Connector PRD. This includes determining who has the bandwidth to take responsibility for the new connector. This could involve deciding which engineer(s) will implement the connector, work on ranking and popularity, and which QA engineer will test the connector.\n\n3. **Development and Testing**: After defining the PRD, the development phase begins, followed by rigorous testing to ensure the connector meets Glean's standards and customer requirements.\n\n4. **Customer Tech Test (Beta)**: Before a full launch, the new connector might go through a beta phase where it's tech-tested with a select group of customers. This phase is crucial for gathering feedback and making necessary adjustments.\n\n5. **Launch**: Once development and internal testing are complete, and the connector is ready for wider use, a launch announcement is made to let everyone know about the new addition to Glean's integrations list. This involves sharing detailed documentation about the connector's functionality and setup with CS and Sales teams.\n\n6. **Further Iteration**: Any further updates or enhancements to the connector will follow the same process, starting with updates to the PRD and design documents, followed by development, testing, and launch as needed.\n\nFor more detailed guidance, including specific steps and considerations at each phase, you should refer to the \"Connector Development Guide\" available on Confluence ([link](https://companywiki.connectordev.guide)) and the internal document on Custom Connectors ([link](https://companydocs.customconnectors.info)). These documents provide comprehensive insights into Glean's process for connector development.\n\nIf you encounter any specific challenges or need further clarification on\"<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nWhere can I find info on how to add a data source?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n- GleanAI: \"To add a data source in Glean, you have a couple of options depending on whether you're adding a custom data source or configuring an existing type of data source. Here's a synthesis of the relevant information from the provided documents:\n\n1. **Add or Update a Data Source**: You can add or update a custom data source and its schema through a specific endpoint. This process involves setting up various parameters such as a unique identifier for the data source instance, a user-friendly display name, the data source category (which cannot be \"UNCATEGORIZED\"), and other details like URL regex for matching document URLs, icon URLs for the data source, and object definitions for top-level object types within the data source. For detailed steps and parameters, refer to the documentation at [Add or Update Datasource](https://companyapi.datasource.add).\n\n2. **Using the Indexing API for Custom Entities**: If your data source involves custom entities, Glean\u2019s Indexing API allows you to index arbitrary content, including custom entities. Custom entities are structured key-value content, which can be more prominently displayed in search results. Toset up a data source for custom entities, you can either use Workspace Settings under Setup > Apps > Add App > Custom, ensuring to check \"This app is used to push custom entities\" under Advanced options, or use the Datasources API to configure the data source as an entity data source. For more information on using the Indexing API for custom entities, you can refer to the document at [Glean Indexing API: Custom Entities](https://companyapi.indexing.customentities).\n\n3. **Getting Started with the Indexing API**: For a broader overview of getting started with indexing in Glean, including setting up a data source and indexing documents, you can refer to the \"Getting Started\" guide. This guide covers the basics of configuring a data source, indexing documents, and enabling the data source to show up in search results. The guide is available at [Indexing API Getting Started](https://companyapi.indexing.gettingstarted).\n\nThese documents provide a comprehensive guide on how to add a data source in Glean, whether you're dealing with custom entities or looking to understand the general process of adding and updating data sources.\"<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nHow do I start with Index API?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n\nYAML Output:\nanalysis: ", "completion": "analysis: Search for documents that provide a beginner's guide or introductory information on using the Index API at Glean.
